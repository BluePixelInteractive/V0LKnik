					                           <h2 id="universe">UNIVERSE</h2>
                     <p>We have become a little crazy, in a good way. We burned old work. Someone shouldn't see it. And the phoenix rises from ashes. And that's where KERA came out. The universe of KERA has some new elements. We took our current solar system as a base. And we have scope by creating other systems in the galaxy. These systems in themselves are important to keep the story consistent.<br> 
                     It precisely takes place on the planet Centha IV. More precisely in the human colony of Kera. And that's where our story unfolds. Before we talk about these places, let us focus on these systems.</p>        
                                
                                               <h2>THE 5 HOMOLOGATED SYSTEMS</h2>
                     <p>In the KERA universe, there are five systems that have been certified and recognized as sheltering human life or possibly accommodating humans. Even if some non-human artifacts have already been found on the planets and stars of many of these systems, no contact with a non-human and intelligent life form has yet been made.<br></p>
					 
                     <p>There is our actual system and 4 others: Baldur Akim system, Vakhadolit system, Zheron Alpha 6 system and the last one is Giltini 69 system. There is a lot of planets, moons and stars with special characteristics. We will focus on two for the purpose of the game, but just know that we haven't created all this information just to keep our universe coherent, we will use them in a certain way.</p>
					 
                     <p>Let's talk about our actual system that we call: System ONE.</p>

                                               <h2>SYTEM ONE</h2>
                     <p>The story takes place in 2632. Centuries before, the situation of humans has deteriorated with the lack of resources, wars, growing poverty. The gap between rich and poor people has widened. But there was no apocalypse. No, humanity has evolved, crossed the stars and conquered the planets of the system one: Mars, Jupiter, etc. Gradually, humans began to leave the earth to discover other horizons. Despite this, there still have interestings things happening at Earth.</p>
                     
                                                <h3>FLYING CITADELS</h3>
                     <p> Citadels are floating megacities that are found on Earth. They were built by <a href="#">Astra</a> and managed by it.These megacities welcome only rich people. They were built by rich people , for themselves. All major cities that we know today have disappeared: New York, Vancouver, Cairo, Beijing, Washington, Paris...to let these megacities rise  The most important citadel among them is Neptunia, the citadel of thousand precious stones.</p>
                     
                                               <h3> NEPTUNIA </h3>
                     <p>Neptunia is first citadel built by Astra. An important place in the universe of KERA because it's representation of pride and vanity of man. Beautiful, shiny, this megacity is seen thousand of miles. For those are not very rich people and who wants to live there, Astra fixed some unfair & ridiculous rules.<br>
					 Rules such as the prohibition of sexual intercourse without prior authorization of a judge. Or the retro-debt which stipulates that "if at the age of 65 the head of a family has not changed his rank , the family leaves Neptunia and is granted to refund all that the Citadel has offered as services since their installation". We had of course poors & destroyed cities around the globe where people are suffering every day, waiting or calling death due to this rules. </p>
					 
					<p>By the way, process of colonization of space has forced humans to create necessary equipment that will serve their ambitions and allow them to sail to infinity.</p>
					 
					                             <h2>SPACE INSTALLATIONS</h2>
												 
												  <h3>ENTRY POINTS </h3>
					<p>An entry point is not a man-made thing. It's a natural thing.These are areas where the spaceships can join systems using the quantum jump. Over time, the explorers discovered several of them, even for which allowed the expansion of humanity. There are several by systems. And even today, others systems, others planets are discovered. And it’s often because of the high numbers of entry points that it is difficult for governments to keep them under surveillance within the homologated systems.</p>
					<p>Entry points face many problems. The biggest problems are pirates, and instability of the points themselves due to primitive material. Since all homologated systems are not inhabited or totally controlled, they have become home of those who want to escape the law and authorities. And by combining the non-surveillance of certain points with the human desire to escape all authority, we obtain points which are insecure and which represent continually a danger for travellers.
                    To control these entry points and allow people to move between systems safely, there are Valkyrie spears and Spaceports.</p>	
					
												 <h3>SPACEPORTS</h3>
				    <p>Spaceports are immense stations built in orbit around importants planets. They are transit areas for travelers, traders and anyone wanting to reach a planet in any approved system.People can thus complete the formalities to get to planets or prepare to go to their final destination.It allows spaceships to land if the final destination is the system in which the port is located. And there are several systems per system, which facilitates inter-system traffic.</p>

												 <h3>VALKYRIES SPEARS</h3>
					<p>Valkyrie spears are tunnel-shaped technological jewelry used to accommodate and assist ships to transit between points of entry. These are spears that secure the entry points. They are not installed along the entry points but just around them when they open into a spaceport. Since the creation and maintenance of these spears is costly, there is not much per system. Installing a valkyrie spears immediately requires installation of a nearby spaceport.</p>
					<p> Discovery of an entry point have allowed explorers to set foot in Giltini 69 system</p>
					
					                            <h2>SYTEM GILTINI 69 </h2>
                   <p>Among the important systems, we have the system Giltine 69 which is the system where Centha IV is . It's the third discovered system but it was the first one whose planets were terraformed to accommodate settlers.</p>
							
                                                <h3>CENTHA IV</h3>
 <p> Centha IV est une planète situé dans le système Giltini 69. L'une des premières planètes a donné un résultat en faveur du processus de terraformation. Le processus n'est toujours complet. Ce qui fait d'elle une planète viable mais potentiellement dangereuse. Malgré cela, des colons ont accepté de venir vivre sur la planète.</p>
 <p> La planète possède des avantages très prisés. Elle regorge d'Iankar, un métal qui n'est présent que sur cette planète.</p>
                                                
                                                 <h3>KERA COLONY</h3>
                                                 <p></p>
												 
												 
												   L'ASTRA est un conglomérat rassemblant des plus de 300 familles de riches et d'intellectuels sous sa coupe. Ce conglomérat possédait des moyens financiers, humains et logistiques énormes. A la tête du groupe, il avait le chancelier Freeg de Fausty. A son arrivée avec l’ASTRA, tout a changé parce qu’il est venu instaurer un Nouvel Ordre Mondial. Cet ordre mondial qui était selon lui, ce dont la Terre avait besoin pour se sortir de l’état pitoyable dans lequel elle était et par la même occasion, panser ses plaies. Pour en savoir plus sur l'ASTRA et les organisations qui peuplent l'organisation, c'est par <a href="#">ici</a><!--Mettre l'ancre vers les organisations importantes du jeu/et sur l'ASTRA-->. Découvrez quel genre d'homme est le chancelier de FAUSTY, <a href="#characters"> ici</a> <br> <!--Créer une ancre directement sur Freeg de Fausty-->
                     
                  
                     
                     
                      <h2 id="story">STORY</h2>
                      <p>"An aristocrat named Keithy Campbak needs someone to investigate the mysterious silence of the Kera Colony. She asks help from Ueshin Security who rejects the job because of the distance and because she came from Astra. And it’s after that she has no other choice to ask help to Harcos Clan. However, the job turns out to be very different than described." This is how our story starts. <br>The players will be sent on this planet to investigate and they will discover another story. They will start from a postulate that <a href="#">Nancy</a> is demonic, wants to dominate or revolts for an absurd reason and that it would necessarily have to be destroyed. They will discover over time that this AI is more human than they imagined. The decision will then be whether it must be maintained or must be destroyed. And the players will have to be influenced by the respective experiences of the character they would have chosen.

</p>
                      
                       <h2 id="characters">CHARACTERS</h2>
                       <p>Our characters are not exceptional characters who would have saved the galaxy with beautiful words. We have not imagined super human, just humans as you see every day as you go out of your house. And that's what's cool. Whether it's the PCs or the NPCs, wait for a lambda who has strengths and weaknesses and is fighting his demons or falling into the abyss.<br>But we paid attention to their personality. We have created unforgettable characters. Our characters will remain in your memory forever because of their way of being, speaking,living.Our characters will be determined by their personality. There will be hypocrites, reserved, extroverts, altruists, etc. But what is interesting is how these multiple personalities react with their environment and with other humans. Will they keep their principles if they have them? Or will they adapt even if they do not take into account what they actually are.</p>
